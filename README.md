# BITRICH

##How It Works

###Deposit Money

Give us 20$, and we convert it to bitcoin

###Set Upper & Lower Limits
Investments are cashed out based on upper and lower limits. We default to 50%, but ultimately, the choice is yours.

###Sit Back and Relax
Watch your money pile up or turn to ashes


## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rdegges/bitrich-www.git
```

Next, you'll want to go into the sample app directory:

```bash
$ cd bitrich-www
```

Then you'll want to install all of the Python requirements (via
[pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)):

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And lastly, you'll want to run the `bootstrap.py` script which will guide you
the rest of the way:

```bash
$ python bootstrap.py
```
