## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

```

Next, you'll want to go into the sample app directory:

Then you'll want to install all of the Python requirements (via
[pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)):

```bash

And lastly, you'll want to run the `bootstrap.py` script which will guide you
